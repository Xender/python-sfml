Python bindings for SFML
========================
This is version |version| of the Python bindings for `SFML`_, based on
SFML |version|, and is made available under the terms of the `LGPLv3`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

These bindings were created in large part by Jonathan De Wachter, with
significant contributions from Edwin Marshall. Other contributors include
Jorge Araya Navarro and Richard Sims.
